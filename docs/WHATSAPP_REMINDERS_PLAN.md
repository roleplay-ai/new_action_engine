# WhatsApp Action Reminders — Plan

Goal: send the participant action reminder (today an email from
`sendDailyActionReminders` in `lib/action-reminders.ts`, on the participant's
chosen weekday — or every weekday on the daily track) over WhatsApp as well,
using the WhatsApp Cloud API on the **Nudgeable consulting** business.

## Key platform constraints

- Business-initiated messages outside the 24-hour customer-service window must
  be **approved templates**. A reminder is always outside that window, so it is
  a template (category: utility).
- Template variables cannot contain newlines, so the WhatsApp reminder is a
  short summary plus a link, not the full email.
- Explicit **opt-in** is required before sending, naming the business and what
  will be sent.
- Delivery status (sent / delivered / read / failed) and user replies only
  arrive via **webhook**.
- Default limits: 80 msg/s per number; ~1 message per 6 s to the same user
  (error 131056); retry failed sends after 4^n seconds. Unverified businesses
  get lower daily send limits.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Meta setup
- Meta app with the WhatsApp use case, linked to the Nudgeable consulting business portfolio.
- Add + register the business phone number; create a system user token
  (`business_management`, `whatsapp_business_messaging`, `whatsapp_business_management`).
- Start Business Verification in parallel.

### Phase 1 — Webhook ✅ (verified end to end on the preview deployment)
- `app/api/webhooks/whatsapp/route.ts`: GET verification handshake, POST with
  `X-Hub-Signature-256` check; parsing in `lib/whatsapp-webhook.ts`.
- `supabase/migrations/082_whatsapp_webhook.sql`: `whatsapp_message_logs`
  (status per wamid, forward-only), `whatsapp_inbound_messages`,
  `whatsapp_webhook_events`.
- Env: `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`.
- Done when: a `hello_world` test send shows sent → delivered → read in
  `whatsapp_message_logs`, and a reply appears in `whatsapp_inbound_messages`.

### Phase 2 — Phone numbers + opt-in ✅ (this branch)
- `supabase/migrations/083_whatsapp_contacts.sql`: `whatsapp_contacts` (one
  number per participant, unique; `opted_out_at` set by STOP) and
  `personal_action_subscriptions.whatsapp_reminders_enabled` /
  `whatsapp_opted_in_at` (per-plan choice; existing plans default off).
- Admin: superadmin → Users → Edit user → **WhatsApp number** (default the
  participant sees; list shows the number and a STOP badge).
- Plan setup (`components/Onboarding.tsx`): **Send my reminders on WhatsApp**,
  ticked by default (unticked if they previously replied STOP), with the
  admin's number pre-filled and editable. Saved by `saveGeneratedActions`.
- My Actions → Plan overview (`components/WhatsAppRemindersCard.tsx`): turn
  WhatsApp off/on or change the number at any time, even after finalising.
- Webhook (`lib/whatsapp-inbound.ts`): STOP / UNSUBSCRIBE pauses WhatsApp for
  every plan; START resumes and re-enables their unarchived plans. Only newly
  received messages are acted on, so Meta retries can't double-process.
- Numbers are normalised to digits with country code; a bare 10-digit number
  is assumed Indian (+91).
- **Phase 4 sends a WhatsApp reminder only when** the plan has
  `whatsapp_reminders_enabled`, the person has a number, and
  `opted_out_at IS NULL`.
- Env: `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` (shows the options), `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  (confirmation replies now, reminders in Phase 4).

### Phase 3 — Templates ✅ submitted (pending Meta review)
Template parameters can't contain line breaks, so each action needs its own
line in the template itself: one UTILITY template per action count, chosen by
`buildActionReminder()` in `lib/whatsapp-templates.ts`.

| Template | Id | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| `action_reminder_1` | 3561293904030778 | 1 (singular, unnumbered) |
| `action_reminder_2` | 3696282903855083 | 2 |
| `action_reminder_3` | 1703608441293691 | 3 |
| `action_reminder_4` | 1969471500396295 | 4 |
| `action_reminder_5` | 28562238106732647 | 5 (6+ actions: "(+N more)" on line 5) |

- Header: "Your {{1}} actions are ready" ({{1}} company; falls back to "Nudgeable").
- Body: "Hi {{1}}, this is your scheduled reminder. These actions from your plan
  are due {{2}}: / 1) {{3}} / 2) {{4}} … / Open Nudgeable to see how to do each
  one and mark them done when you finish." — {{2}} "this week" | "today".
- Footer: "Reply STOP to turn off WhatsApp reminders".
- URL button "View my actions" →
  `https://practice.nudgeable.ai/api/auto-login?next=%2Factions&key={{1}}`
  (persistent login key, same as reminder emails); Meta link tracking off.
- **Wording must stay strictly factual.** `action_reminder_company` added
  "Nudgie here!", "Small steps, real change 💪" and emoji, and Meta approved it
  as MARKETING instead of UTILITY (utility = no promotional or persuasive
  intent; mixed content → marketing). Repeated misclassification can get the
  business's utility templates restricted. Earlier drafts `action_reminder`
  (UTILITY) and `action_reminder_company` (MARKETING) are not used by the code.
- Approval/rejection arrives on the webhook as
  `message_template_status_update` (stored in `whatsapp_webhook_events`).

### Phase 4 — Sending ✅ (this branch)
- `lib/whatsapp-reminders.ts` `sendWhatsAppActionReminders()`, called from the
  daily cron (`app/api/cron/email-scheduler/route.ts`) right after the batch
  release and before the Resend check, so WhatsApp doesn't depend on email.
- Mirrors the reminder email exactly: active, unarchived plans linked to a
  batch; same days (`reminderDaysFor()` in `lib/reminder-days.ts`, shared with the email); same actions
  (`buildReminderActionContext()`: the plan's current actions in that batch).
- Sends only when `whatsapp_reminders_enabled`, a number exists, and
  `opted_out_at IS NULL`; skips plans with no current actions.
- Template `action_reminder_N` by action count via `buildActionReminder()`;
  company from the batch's company; button = persistent login key.
- `supabase/migrations/084_whatsapp_reminder_claims.sql`: one claim per plan
  per IST day (`claim_whatsapp_reminder`), separate from the email claim;
  failed sends retried by a rerun after 15 min, max 3 attempts. The claim
  stores the wamid; delivery/read/failure lands in `whatsapp_message_logs`.
- The cron response includes a `whatsappReminders` summary (sent, failed,
  skipped: not due / no number / opted out / empty / already claimed).
- Plans not linked to a batch get no reminders on either channel (existing
  email behaviour, kept as is).

### Phase 5 — Admin + extras
- ✅ Superadmin → Emails & reminders → **WhatsApp reminders** tab
  (`app/(app)/superadmin/whatsapp-reminders-panel.tsx`,
  `app/actions/whatsapp-reminders-admin.ts`):
  - Upcoming: every active plan with WhatsApp on — number, batch, schedule,
    next 11:30 send, the exact actions and template it will use, or why it
    can't be sent (no number, replied STOP, no current actions, no login key).
  - **Send WhatsApp now** for selected participants: same content as the cron
    (shared `prepareWhatsAppReminders` / `sendPreparedWhatsAppReminder`), can
    be repeated, doesn't use up the automatic reminder (no daily claim).
  - Delivery history: every reminder (automatic or sent now) with the
    webhook's sent / delivered / read / failed status and Meta error.
- Later: Friday recap on WhatsApp; bulk CSV import of numbers; optional
  per-cohort rollout flag; "Done" quick-reply button completing the action.

### Option A — "Done" buttons complete actions from WhatsApp (this branch)
- A participant has at most three current actions (weekly plans are capped at
  3 per week), so the reminder uses one of three UTILITY templates,
  `plan_reminder_1…3` — no header, no app link or login key:
  "Hi {{1}} 👋, this is your scheduled reminder. These actions from your {{2}}
  plan are due {{3}}:" ({{2}} company, {{3}} "this week" | "today"), then each
  action as "1) {{4}}" with a blank line between, then "When you complete an
  action, click its button below to update its status as done.", footer
  "Reply STOP to turn off WhatsApp reminders", and one QUICK_REPLY button per
  action ("Action done" / "Action 1 done"…"Action 3 done"), all inline.
  Submitted for review: `plan_reminder_1` (2571905986564041),
  `plan_reminder_2` (1101638012755695), `plan_reminder_3` (1449500153780527).
- **Utility anchors:** "this is your scheduled reminder", "from your … plan"
  and "are due …" tie the message to the participant's own plan. Two drafts
  without them were approved as MARKETING (`action_reminder_company`,
  `action_checklist_1…3` — the latter with "your {{2}} actions are ready",
  number emoji and ✅). Earlier unused sets: `action_reminder_1…5` (no
  buttons), `action_done_1…3` (UTILITY, but with a company header that can't
  be removed by editing), `action_checkin_1…3` (deleted).
- Each payload is set per message to `done:<n>:<id1>,<id2>,<id3>` — the tapped
  number plus every action in that reminder (ids without dashes) — so
  follow-ups keep the original numbering with nothing stored.
- A tap arrives on the webhook; `lib/whatsapp-inbound.ts` maps the sender's
  number → participant (`whatsapp_contacts`), completes the action
  (`completeActionFromWhatsApp`) and replies, free-form (the tap opened the
  24-hour window, no template): "✅ Saved! Action 2 is marked done" (no points
  or Surprise Box line),
  "2 actions left: 1️⃣ … 3️⃣ …" with [Action 1 done] [Action 3 done]; repeats per tap until
  "🎉 Well done, you've completed all your actions! Keep the momentum going." (`buildCompletionFollowUp`).
- `supabase/migrations/085_complete_action_for_user.sql`:
  `complete_action_for_user(user, action)` acts as the participant for one
  transaction and calls the same RPCs as the app's `completeAction`
  (older scored plans / wallet on time or late / Pending validation →
  validated / Surprise Box unlock). Service role only. Profile points and the
  feed event are added in TypeScript, mirroring `completeAction`.
- Only actions on that participant's plan can be completed; repeat taps reply
  "already marked done" with the same still-open list.
- If a reminder ever had more than three actions, line 3 reads "(+N more)" and
  only the first three get buttons.
- `action_reminder_1…5` (approved, no buttons) are kept but no longer used.
